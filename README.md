# rand_multiply.py
This Python script randomly chooses 2 numbers between 1 and 10 and multiplies them for you. Perfect for little ones who are learning their multiplication tables!

Integers can be changed to randomize higher numbers if you wish and pause time can be lengthened before the answer
is revealed to give students more time to come up with the answer.
